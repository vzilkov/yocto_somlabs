Functional requirements (what I did and what to be done)
rk_func_boot_idle - done
After booting target shall blink LED1 with a frequency of 2Hz.
rk_func_boot_connection_start - done
As soon as connection with host is established LED2 shall be switched on and LED1 off.
rk_func_boot_connection_stop - done
As soon as target recognises a lost connection LED2 shall be switched off and LED1 returns to the
state as defined in rk_func_boot_idle.
rk_func_communication_confirmation - done
Each sent or received data package shall be confirmed by blinking LED2 with a frequency of 4Hz.
rk_func_communication_sensor - not done, just imitation, without host.
Every second data from Sensor (single or multiple) are sent to host.
Host shall be able to check the integrity of received data and visualize it.
rk_func_sensor_alert_define - not done, planned to implement it on host side.
It shall be possible to define an alert if a defined range for sensor data will be exceeded.
rk_func_sensor_alert_reaction - done
Each alert shall be confirmed (e.g. using HWButton1) before the system returns to its working
state.
